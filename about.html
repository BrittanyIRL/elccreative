				<p>Hi there. We are just another pair of Millennials trying to balance committed day jobs with meaningful side hustles. Life can be full up on frustration and is often short on free time, but it doesn’t have to be boring. At least we don’t think so. We're programmers and analysts by trade and storytellers at heart. We’re married and we're pragmatic dreamers. Oh, and we really, really love New Order. It's crazy that the band that rose from the ashes of Joy Division out of necessity became the joy-filled love vigilantes we now look up to. Our favorite New Order song (and the namesake of our project) reminds us that every second counts when we're creating something together. We want to spread that feeling and try and help make life a bit sweeter in our own way.</p>

				<h3>Gerrit</h3>
				<p>Gerrit is an actuary, which he always tells people is what Ben Stiller does in Along Came Polly, even though that is actually underwriting. He likes working with predictive analytics and data visualization. In his other time, he writes for himself, for the independent Seattle radio station KEXP, and any contest for a cash prize over $25. He likes the idea of being goth, but finds the wardrobe to be impractical. His favorite Nicholas Cage movie is Wild at Heart.</p>

				<h3>Brittany</h3>
				<p>Brittany is a web developer who really prefers the front end because she wants to remain human. She likes working with everything javascript and css. In her other time, she takes photos for the independent Seattle radio station KEXP, and splits reading time between campy near-future science fiction and memoirs by funny ladies. She has all too frequent dreams about velociraptors due to seeing Jurassic Park too young. Her favorite Nicholas Cage movie is Valley Girl.</p>
